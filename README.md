### MVP UI Prototype for Banking App

A new [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) project intended to serve as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** user interface for a banking application. This setup is excellent for rapid prototyping and demonstrating core UI concepts quickly.

### Scalability and Customization Note

While this project is a good start, it is designed for simplicity and speed.

* **Scalability:** For massive, production-grade applications, the current architectural patterns will likely become **slow and difficult to manage** as the feature set grows.
* **Customization:** Implementing deeply custom themes, complex state management, or highly optimized native performance will be **harder to customize** in this simple structure compared to a more advanced, enterprise-level architecture.
